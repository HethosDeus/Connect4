# Connect4 Game: What I've Learned
This is a simple implementation of Connect Four in Java for class, and the first project with some autonomy given for project creation, design and implementation.
This project has helped give me a better understanding of PSP, project planning and design pocess, object-oriented programming, user interface and interaction, I/O and GUI design and interaction, and javadoc generation.  

TODOs:
- [DONE] create game logic for game in Connect4.java
- [DONE] create user interface for the game to be played in text console.
- [DONE] create naive computer AI for simple computer-based play.
- [DONE] create functional GUI application for game.
- [WIP] create client/server applications to play game online.
- [WIP] refine and refactor existing code
